# DeepClone

**DeepClone** is javascript function that you can use as an alternative to third-party libraries for cloning object structures. By using recursion, it returns an exact copy of the original object, not a mere reference in memory.

## Getting Started

### Installing

Installation should be as smooth as: 

 1. Getting a copy of this repo:

    ```
    git clone https://github.com/luisrowley/DeepClone
    ```

 2. Changing to the project directory:

    ```
    cd DeepClone
    ```

 3. And installing the needed dependencies by running:

    ```
    npm i
    ```

### Usage

To be used in a node environment, you can simply import it by: 

 1. Using the **require** syntax:

    ```
    var deepClone = require("../functions/deepClone.js")
    ```
